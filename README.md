# Trivia Project

- This project uses google gemini api for making the questions that way one can have unlimited amount of questions.
- The project is Vite + Reactjs
- Made this project because i wanted a trivia / quiz app that kills time and also beneficial in some way that is add free so when i got this idea. I also wanted to try llm apis since I did not try them before this so got an idea how to write a decent system Prompt (I know the project system Prompt is bad).
